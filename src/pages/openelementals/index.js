        I can't fathom the idea of living a so called 'normal' life. For me, that is a far bigger risk to take than sacrificing and giving up everything for a cause and mission that has never been charted before. That's how I feel about what I am doing now with digital fashion, web3, the metaverse. This is exactly what I want to be doing and where I need to be. This mission is so astronomically crucial for all of us. It just cannot be cast aside or undervalued. And, I feel so intrinsically invested in making sure that everything I do in my life substantially moves this mission forward no matter what it takes. I hope to inspire many others to join and pioneer alongside me.
